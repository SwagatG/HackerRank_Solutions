My Solutions to HackerRank's Adaptations of Project Euler Problems
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I have always had a keen interest in mathematics, and, from a young age, have been consistently amazed by the applications of mathematical concepts. When I discovered the opportunity provided by Project Euler to delve into various realms of mathematics while also developing my programming abilities, I was more than eager to begin.

My solutions all begin with a comment describing the goal of the program (as stated on HackerRank), so it is not necessary to search for this online. More Information on Project Euler is provided below.

<h3>About Project Euler</h3>
<i>(As Described On projecteuler.net)</i>

<b>What is Project Euler?</b>

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

<b>Who are the problems aimed at?</b>

The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.

<b>Can anyone solve the problems?</b>

The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So the determined participant will slowly but surely work his/her way through every problem.
